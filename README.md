This is an arrhythmia detection tool designed at the LUMC.
The script reads through a .csv of calcium traces of cardiomyocyte contraction data outputting results on these contractions along with a prediction if they are arrhythmogenic or not.

Please read the attached manual to understand how the script works and how it can be used to analyse your data.
